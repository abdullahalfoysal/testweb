My grandmother was kmitting awoollen scarf for ffthe winter months. She was very old, dressed in a plain white sari;her eyes were not very strong now,but her fingers moved    uickly with the needles, and the needles kept clicking all afternoon. Grandmother had white hair, but there were very few wrinkles on her skin.</p>
